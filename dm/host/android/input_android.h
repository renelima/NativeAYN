// What the Android launcher calls in libnxhost.so besides nxhost_main: input forwarding, touch, motion, rumble and the Activity lifecycle (android/PORTING.md, "Launcher interface").
// Every function may be called from any thread, before or after nxhost_main has started. jni_android.c binds the same functions to the launcher's Kotlin class.
// device: Android's InputDevice id. The host gives each device a player (pad_slots.h: player 1 first, a device that comes back gets its player back).

// ---- Gamepads ----
// A device is connected by its first event too; added only names it (for its player when it comes back) and says whether its face buttons carry Nintendo's labels in Android's names

// ---- Touch ----

// ---- Rumble ----
// Optional. The host calls fn(ctx, player, intensity, sharpness) from its rumble thread whenever a player's vibration changes: intensity 0 stops it, otherwise 0..1, sharpness 0..1
// (low to high frequency). Set it before nxhost_main; route(player, 1) says that player has a vibrator (the phone for player 1, a controller's VibratorManager for the rest)

// event: 0 onPause, 1 onStop, 2 onStart (after onStop), 3 onResume, 4 pause, 5 continue. The app is suspended while it is stopped (1 until 2) or paused (4 until 5):
// audio suspended, the guest clock frozen, the graphics drained and gated, the guest threads stopped at their next SVC (dm_guest_suspend), the game told Background; it
// comes back OutOfFocus and InFocus once resumed (3). Each change of suspension logs a "[lifecycle] …" line with the threads' CPU since the last one. Audio focus loss (AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS / LOSS_TRANSIENT) is an interruption: nxhost_audio_interrupt(true), and false when focus comes back
NXHOST_API void nxhost_lifecycle(int event);

// fps: 0 = the game's own frame rate, else 15, 20, 30, 40, 45 or 60, applied while the game runs (hle_fpslock.c dm_fps_target_set); DM_FPS_TARGET sets it at start.
