# NativeAYN changelog

Changes in NativeAYN, grouped by topic. Most of the new behaviour is behind `DM_*` switches (every one is listed in
[docs/env_switches.tsv](docs/env_switches.tsv)); the ones Ocarina of Time needs are set by its game profile
([dm/games/0400486024DEC000/game.tsv](dm/games/0400486024DEC000/game.tsv)), so other games keep their old behaviour unless a switch is set.
The credits for the code it is built on are in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## NativeAYN 0.1.0 (2026-11-09)

NativeAYN's first release. The sections below it are the base project's history; NativeAYN's own versioning starts here.

- **NativeAYN identity**: the player is renamed and rebranded end to end — package `dev.nativeayn.android`, its own "N" mark, launcher icon and a deep navy/teal always-dark palette (the "Deep Space Cockpit" layout: 64 dp header with a teal accent rule, tighter cards, gradient game tiles); the README and all project documentation are in Brazilian Portuguese.
- **Controller mapping** (new): the in-game panel's **Controller** section maps the handheld's physical buttons to game buttons — tap the row, press the button, saved per connected pad, with adjustable dead zone; the map re-applies when the pad reconnects.
- **Keep screen on** (new): the game and the launcher keep the screen lit while open; the system idle timer no longer sleeps a running session.
- **On-screen controls**: the always-visible round button at the top centre is gone; **Show the on-screen buttons** now sits in the in-game panel's On-screen controls section with the other control settings, and switches the buttons on and off at once (the panel opens by its handle at the right edge, Back, or a gamepad's Home button).
- **In-game menu redesigned as a console pause menu**: the panel is now one row per section — Frame rate cap, Frame generation, Upscaling, On-screen controls, Overlay, Controller mapping, Intro skip (where armed) and Pause or stop — each with an icon tile, its name, its current state as a subtitle and a chevron, under a header with the NativeAYN mark and the running game's name over a teal rule. Each row opens a dialog with that section's full controls; every change applies to the running game at once and is kept for the next start. The row icons are the panel's own vector marks in its teal: the Ocarina hourglass, the Triforce and a Triforce piece, a D-pad, the Sheikah eye, a reticle, fast-forward and pause.
- **In-app update works for this app**: the NativeAYN app (a `-PnxAppId` build, `dev.nativeayn.android`) now checks its own GitHub releases at start and from Settings › Updates, debug builds included (`NX_PRODUCT`); before, only the signed release app checked, so the builds this project ships never offered updates. Tested end to end on the Odin 3: the v0.1.0 popup with its notes, the APK downloaded from the release asset, its SHA-256 checked against the API digest, installed through `PackageInstaller`. An update installs over the running app, so it needs the installed app and the release APK signed with the same key (today both are the debug key).
- **Version shown, git not**: Home, the overlay and the About line show `v<version>` (for example `v0.1.0`); branch and commit no longer appear in any player-visible text (the signer id in the logs still identifies a build).
- **Build**: `-PnxAppId=<id>` builds the renamed app; Ocarina of Time (`0400486024DEC000`) is the flagship title, measured on the AYN Odin 3 (Adreno 830, Android 15). The Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World profiles are carried over and not revalidated in this release.

## NativeAYN 0.2.1

- **Prepare on the phone stopped at the end for Ocarina of Time** ([#3](https://github.com/renelima/NativeAYN/issues/3)): "76 of 42346 shaders did
  not build: no library written". The same 76 do not build on a computer either (74 that SPIRV-Tools refuses, "Vector access is out of bounds"; a
  mesh program without a mesh layout; Ampere instruction 481), and the game plays without them. The phone's job writes a library only when every
  shader that builds on a computer built, and learns which ones do not from the profile's manifest, which Ocarina of Time did not have yet. Its
  manifest is now in the profile (`dm/games/0400486024DEC000/vk_delta.tsv`, `--publish-delta` from the full Linux build of `v-0dd4341ae6ce`). Checked
  on Linux with the phone's rule (`DMSH_VK_REQUIRE_ALL=1`): without the manifest the build stops with the issue's message; with it, the library is
  written, byte for byte the one the computer's build made. Retry on the phone translates only the 76 again and then finishes.
- **Preparing on Windows and Linux.** `scripts/pack_android.py` runs on Windows, Linux and the Mac (android/README.md, The environment):
  - the shader translator starts through a launcher beside `dmsh_xlate.dll` for each system (`dmsh_xlate-<linux|win>-<x64|arm64>`, .NET apphosts of the
    same translator); the committed `dmsh_xlate` is the Mac's. Checked on Linux: 75 Ocarina of Time shaders translate byte for byte as with the
    earlier `dotnet dmsh_xlate.dll` wrapper, and the library version stays `v-0dd4341ae6ce`.
  - Windows: text files are written with LF line ends (`scripts/lf_newlines.py`), the code is rewritten in one process (no `fork`), the RomFS paths
    of a folder dump use `/` (`shader_split.py`), and files are replaced in place where a rename would fail.
  - `.gitattributes` checks every text file out with LF, so the shader versions and the rewrite key are the same on every system.
  - `tool_lock.py` checks the translator the environment's `XLATE` names.
  - CI (`.github/workflows/prepare-pc.yml`) checks this on Windows and Linux.
- Discussions are open, with a [device reports](https://github.com/renelima/NativeAYN/discussions/1) thread.

## NativeAYN 0.2.0

- **Prepare on the phone.** The APK now carries the real on-phone packer (CPython 3.14 with the repository's tools, the shader translator
  `libdmsh_xlate.so` and SPIRV-Tools), so Add game â€º Prepare makes a game's pack from the dump on the phone itself. Experimental: on the POCO F8 Pro
  with Ocarina of Time, the code rewrite took about 3 minutes and the shader scan of the game's 186,583 files about 30; the shader translation was
  still being tested when this was released.
- The packer's build (`android/ondevice/build.sh`, `dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_android/build.sh`, `build_spirv_tools.sh`) runs with bash on Linux as well
  as on the Mac, and adds **zbic**: the zstd-compressed (ZBIC) code segments of system 22.0.0+ games, which Ocarina of Time has, need it to be read.
- The code rewrite and the shader scan report progress from their start (a module count; a stage line before the file count is known), so the
  step no longer sits at 0 for minutes.
- `android/tools/release.sh` builds with the real packer by default (`ANKA_PACK_ENGINE=native`, the stage from `NX_PACK_STAGE`).

## NativeAYN 0.1.1

- **Prepare on the phone looked done but made nothing to play.** 0.1.0 was built without the on-phone packer (`-PnxPackEngine=fake`), so its
  Prepare ran the simulated engine: the progress finished, but the pack it made is a placeholder with no game code and no shaders, and Play could
  not start it. A play or release build without the packer now offers no Prepare (`Ondevice.available()`): Home and the game's card say to prepare
  the game on a computer (README "Install") and to pick that pack, and a placeholder pack left by 0.1.0 is shown as "No pack" and Play says why.
  Test builds keep the simulated engine for UI work.

## NativeAYN 0.1.0

The first release: Ocarina of Time (the Switch 2 remake, `0400486024DEC000`) brought up on Android. Measured on one phone only, a POCO F8 Pro
(Snapdragon, Adreno 830, 12 GB of RAM) with a Turnip driver. Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World were not tested again after these changes.

### The name and the app

- The app is now called **NativeAYN**. New app ids: the release app `dev.ankanative.android`, a per-game app `dev.ankanative.android.<suffix>`
  (`-PnxApp=oot` makes `dev.ankanative.android.oot`), the test app
  `dev.ankanative.android.test`. Each has its own data folder (`Android/data/<app id>/files`), so it installs beside older builds and does not touch their
  saves.
- The Anka mark (a phoenix rising, with flame wings) as the launcher icon, the in-app mark and the notification icon; the launcher's colours follow it
  (fire gold and orange on warm ivory, or on a warm night in dark mode). `android/tools/anka_icons.py` writes the icons from `anka_logo.py`.
- The committed translator `dm/gfx/tools/dmsh_xlate_bin/dmsh_xlate.dll` (and its `.pdb`) was rebuilt from the same source with the build folder mapped
  to `/_/` (`-p:PathMap`), so it names no local folder. Only the dll's fingerprint changed, so the chain versions moved (`DMSH_CHAIN` `d4f17b9bdef3`,
  library `v-0dd4341ae6ce`); a library of the previous version has the same `DMSH_VK_ABI` and is still played.
- Game profiles: only Ocarina of Time (`0400486024DEC000`), Donkey Kong Bananza (`040074A01BF12000`) and Mario Kart World (`0400C3F00006E000`) are
  kept; nxnative's 127 other profiles, their rows in the games table and the tests and tool that needed them (`test_astral_fps.py`,
  `check_thread_cuts.py`) were removed. `dm/tools/sdk_patches.py` is unchanged (it is part of the rewrite key, so packs stay current).
- About: the app names its license, GPL-3.0-or-later as a whole, and points to NOTICE.md; logs and the Vulkan application name say "NativeAYN".
- Release signing: `-PnxLive=true` reads the key from `ANKA_KEYSTORE`, `ANKA_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANKA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `ANKA_KEY_PASSWORD` (environment
  or `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`); `android/tools/release.sh` builds, signs, verifies and checksums a release ([docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md)).
  `Signer.OFFICIAL` holds the release certificate's SHA-256 (`4d7443354f53â€¦3bb0`), so only builds signed with that key call
  themselves official.
- APK names `anka-native-<suffix>.apk`; exported packs `anka-pack-<title ID>-<version>.zip`; the in-app updater looks at this project's releases.
- Game settings > **RAM saver (uses storage)**, per game, off by default: the game's large write-once texture pools live in a file in the app's cache
  folder instead of in RAM (`DM_MEM_FILEBACK=1`, `DM_MEM_FILEBACK_KINDS=shader,texture`). For phones short of RAM with free storage: in Ocarina of Time
  it writes about 2 GB to storage per area load.

### Ocarina of Time (`0400486024DEC000`, update v131072)

- New game profile: boots from a `.nup` dump to the title screen, the opening movie and into the game; the code rewrite and the shader library were made
  on Linux.
- **Game speed at a low frame rate.** The game's frame-ratio division is stepped by the host (a frame-step patch, ported from upstream): at 15 fps the
  game ran at about a quarter of its speed, now at about 0.8-1.0.
- **Anti-aliasing shaders restored.** `shader_split.py` steps 8 bytes past a record that is not a control section (ported from upstream), which finds
  the game's SMAA shaders again (library `v-04fb6ae9ea34`). The pass runs, but its blend weights are still all zero, so there is no visible change yet.
- **A stand-in for agl's NDSR upscaler network** (`DM_VK_NDSR_STANDIN=1`): the network is not run; its output image gets its input sampled bilinearly.

### Memory (the game did not survive its first forest load on 12 GB before)

- **GPU texture-use feedback** (`DM_VK_TEXFB`): the shader library's modules set a bit for each texture-pool ID they index, so the host knows which named
  textures the GPU really uses; under memory pressure the ones it has not used are released (`DM_VK_TEXFB=2`). Its GPU cost was about zero (74.5 against
  75.2 ms). With it the forest load survived for the first time (peak 3,007 MiB).
- **Coarse-first textures** (`DM_VK_SCAN_COARSE`): under memory pressure a texture only a pool scan named is made at a coarse mip first (-157 MiB at the
  forest load).
- **Rate-based memory pressure** (`DM_VK_PRESS_RATE`) with hysteresis (`DM_VK_PRESS_HYST_MB`), and mip drop for more texture kinds (`DM_VK_MIPDROP`):
  pressure starts when available memory falls fast, not only when it is already low, and stays on long enough. Textures remade within 30 s fell from 66 %
  to 44 %, then to 6.6 % with the hysteresis; the remake after pressure ends is spread over frames (a 2.5 s stall became 0.36-0.44 s in 8 of 9 cases).
- **Guest-aliased render targets** (`DM_VK_RTALIAS`, `DM_VK_RTALIAS_MB`): a render target that starts at the same guest address as an earlier one shares
  its allocation. One depth target took a new size almost every frame and got new memory each time (+345 MiB in 110 frames); with aliasing, no extra
  render target memory, and the game left Link's house into Kokiri Forest.
- **File-backed memory pools** (`DM_MEM_FILEBACK`): shader-code pools (and, with the RAM saver, texture pools) as clean file pages the kernel can drop
  instead of compressing them into zram (page faults 2.7k/s to 0.9k/s). Shader-code pools are no longer placed (`DM_VK_PLACE_SHADER_POOLS=0`).
- Fewer page index buffers for Ocarina of Time (`DM_VK_GMEM_PIDX_BUFS=2`, -41 MiB) and a per-pool memory footprint log (`DM_MEM_FOOT`).

### Speed

- **Per-page pool index in the shaders** (library `v-fc7819d73925`): a shader that reads guest memory through a pointer found its pool with an unrolled
  search (253 searches, 82k instructions, 1,236 spills in the forest's terrain shaders); it now reads one 8-byte record per 4 KiB page. Vertex shaders
  became 3-4x faster (Link's house: 2,570 to 695 ns per invocation), GPU time at Link's house 121.6 to 59.1 ms, and the frame rate at the start 4.8-5.4 to
  12.7-16.2 fps. The index costs about 83 MiB.
- **Pipeline-cache saver capped** (`DM_VK_PCACHE_MIN_S`, `DM_VK_PCACHE_QUIET_S`): the pipeline cache was written 36.7 GB in 3 minutes; now 0.88 GB in
  8.6 minutes, and frames over 1 s while walking fell from 13 to 0.
- A sampler LOD bias floor (`DM_VK_LOD_BIAS_MIN=0`, off by default): softens texture shimmer by 10-25 % when on.

### Diagnostics

- Render-target, light-list and per-pipeline GPU time logs, pipeline statistics, NaN scans (`DM_VK_NANSCAN`) and memory footprint lines, used to find
  the causes above; all off by default.
